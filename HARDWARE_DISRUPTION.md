## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Get overview of all hardware disruption tools
apt-analyzer hardware-disruption

# Analyze specific target type
apt-analyzer hardware-disruption --target-type military_bases

# Execute specific disruption tool
apt-analyzer hardware-disruption --tool gps_jammer

# Output as JSON
apt-analyzer hardware-disruption --target-type naval_facilities --json
```

### Python API

```python
from apt_toolkit.hardware_disruption import (
    HardwareDisruptionEngine,
    analyze_hardware_disruption
)

# Get overview
analysis = analyze_hardware_disruption()

# Analyze specific target type
target_analysis = analyze_hardware_disruption(target_type="military_bases")

# Execute specific tool
execution_result = analyze_hardware_disruption(tool_name="gps_jammer")

# Using the engine directly
engine = HardwareDisruptionEngine(seed=42)
overview = engine.get_all_tools()
target_analysis = engine.analyze_target_type("naval_facilities")
execution = engine.execute_disruption("drone_hijacker")
```

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **numpy**: Signal generation and mathematical operations
- **scipy**: Signal processing for jamming tools
- **pymodbus**: Industrial control system communication
- **socket**: Network communication for disruption tools

### Tool Architecture

Each hardware disruption tool follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Signal Generation Tools** (GPS Jammer, Radar Jammer, Radio Jammer)
   - Generate jamming signals using numpy/scipy
   - Return signal data for analysis

2. **Network Disruption Tools** (Drone Hijacker, Satellite Disruption, etc.)
   - Attempt network connections to target systems
   - Send disruption commands via sockets

3. **Industrial Control Tools** (Power Grid, Water Supply)
   - Use Modbus protocol for industrial systems
   - Attempt to manipulate control registers
