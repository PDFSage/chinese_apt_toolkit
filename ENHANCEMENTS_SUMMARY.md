- **Polyglot Payload Engine**: Multi-format malicious documents with embedded exploits (CVE-2021-40444, CVE-2022-30190, CVE-2023-21716)
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Targeted activation on government/military networks

### 2. Sophisticated Persistence
- **Multi-Layer Persistence Framework**: WMI, scheduled tasks, COM hijacking, logon scripts
- **Fileless Persistence**: Memory-only techniques using PowerShell reflection and WMI methods
- **Counter-Forensic Measures**: Timestomping, log cleaning, memory anti-forensics

### 3. Advanced Privilege Escalation
- **ADCS Exploitation Suite**: ESC1-ESC8 vulnerabilities including certificate template abuse and NTLM relay
- **Advanced Kerberos Attacks**: Golden/Diamond tickets, Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting
- **Cloud Identity Attacks**: SAML token forgery, OAuth consent phishing, conditional access bypass

### 4. Enhanced Defense Evasion
- **Advanced EDR Evasion**: Direct syscalls, ETW patching, AMSI bypass, return address spoofing
- **Process Injection Evasion**: Process hollowing, atom bombing, herpaderping, process ghosting
- **Living Off The Land**: Advanced LOTL techniques with command obfuscation
