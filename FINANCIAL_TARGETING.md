apt-analyzer financial investment

# Target cryptocurrency exchanges
apt-analyzer financial crypto

# Target all major financial sectors
apt-analyzer financial all

# Generate financial theft campaign
apt-analyzer financial theft --institutions banks,crypto --method account_takeover

# Output as JSON
apt-analyzer financial targets --json
```

### Python API

```python
from apt_toolkit.financial_targeting import (
    FinancialTargetingEngine,
    analyze_financial_targets
)

from apt_toolkit.financial_theft_methods import (
    FinancialTheftEngine,
    generate_financial_theft_campaign
)

# Basic financial target analysis
analysis = analyze_financial_targets()

# Targeted analysis
banks_analysis = analyze_financial_targets(["banks"])
crypto_analysis = analyze_financial_targets(["cryptocurrency_exchanges"])

# With deterministic seed
analysis = analyze_financial_targets(seed=42)

# Generate financial theft campaign
theft_campaign = generate_financial_theft_campaign(
    institution_types=["banks", "cryptocurrency_exchanges"],
    primary_method="account_takeover",
    seed=42
)

# Using the engines directly
targeting_engine = FinancialTargetingEngine(seed=42)
analysis = targeting_engine.analyze_financial_targets(["banks", "investment_firms"])

theft_engine = FinancialTheftEngine(seed=42)
methods = theft_engine.get_all_theft_methods()
campaign = theft_engine.generate_theft_campaign(["banks", "payment_processors"])
```
