# Financial Institution Targeting Module

## Overview

The Financial Institution Targeting Module provides advanced capabilities for targeting financial institutions including banks, investment firms, payment processors, cryptocurrency exchanges, and regulatory bodies. This module enables comprehensive analysis of financial targets with estimated financial values, threat assessments, and money theft simulation capabilities.

## Features

### Target Types
- **Banks**: Major banking institutions (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.)
- **Investment Firms**: Asset management and investment companies (BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, etc.)
- **Payment Processors**: Payment processing companies (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe, etc.)
- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges**: Digital asset trading platforms (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.)
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Financial regulatory agencies (Federal Reserve, SEC, FDIC, etc.)

### Capabilities
- **Target Profiling**: Generate realistic financial institution domains and employee profiles
- **Value Estimation**: Calculate potential financial gains from targeting specific institutions
- **Threat Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis and detection likelihood assessment
- **Social Engineering**: Financial-themed lure generation for targeted attacks
- **Impact Analysis**: Market impact assessment and recommended exfiltration methods

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Analyze all financial institution types
apt-analyzer financial targets

# Target only banks
apt-analyzer financial banks

# Target investment firms
apt-analyzer financial investment

# Target cryptocurrency exchanges
apt-analyzer financial crypto

# Target all major financial sectors
apt-analyzer financial all

# Output as JSON
apt-analyzer financial targets --json
```

### Python API

```python
from apt_toolkit.financial_targeting import (
    FinancialTargetingEngine,
    analyze_financial_targets
)

# Basic analysis
analysis = analyze_financial_targets()

# Targeted analysis
banks_analysis = analyze_financial_targets(["banks"])
crypto_analysis = analyze_financial_targets(["cryptocurrency_exchanges"])

# With deterministic seed
analysis = analyze_financial_targets(seed=42)

# Using the engine directly
engine = FinancialTargetingEngine(seed=42)
analysis = engine.analyze_financial_targets(["banks", "investment_firms"])
```

## Value Estimation Ranges

| Institution Type | Low Value | High Value | Currency |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Banks | $1,000,000 | $50,000,000 | USD |
| Investment Firms | $5,000,000 | $100,000,000 | USD |
| Payment Processors | $2,000,000 | $75,000,000 | USD |
| Cryptocurrency Exchanges | $10,000,000 | $200,000,000 | USD |
| Regulatory Bodies | $500,000 | $10,000,000 | USD |

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors
- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges**: Highest risk/reward (10/10)
- **Investment Firms**: High risk/reward (9/10)
- **Banks**: Medium-high risk/reward (8/10)
- **Payment Processors**: Medium risk/reward (7/10)
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Lower risk/reward (6/10)

### Risk Levels
- **CRITICAL**: ≥80 risk score
- **HIGH**: 60-79 risk score
- **MEDIUM**: 40-59 risk score
- **LOW**: <40 risk score

## Attack Vectors

### Financial-Specific Techniques
- **SWIFT Manipulation**: Intercept and modify international bank transfers
- **ACH Fraud**: Unauthorized Automated Clearing House transactions
- **Account Takeover**: Credential theft and account compromise
- **Trade Manipulation**: Algorithmic trading system exploitation
- **Wallet Compromise**: Cryptocurrency wallet private key theft
- **API Abuse**: Financial API endpoint exploitation
- **Smart Contract Exploit**: Blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities

## Detection Avoidance

### Recommended Approaches
- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges**: Focus on wallet compromise and trading manipulation
- **Investment Firms**: Target algorithmic trading systems and portfolio management
- **Banks**: Emphasize SWIFT manipulation and account takeover
- **Payment Processors**: Transaction interception and fraud system bypass
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Data manipulation and policy influence
